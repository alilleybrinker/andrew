Had this idea of turning my own personal automation into a "personal CLI,"
a little Rust program I ship that automates my common tasks and that I can
then just install where I want it. This seems like a fun approach to
experiment with. Nothing written yet, but if I like this approach I'd like
to write about it and encourage this "personal CLI" as a pattern.
